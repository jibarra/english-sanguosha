## English Sanguosha
This web application displays the results from the parser app. It reads in a JSON file to act as the data for the application and displays it. This is an Angular.js app.

## Parser App
The parser web app is a simple Javascript app that uses jQuery to parse the original English Sanguosha site http://www.englishsanguosha.com/. The app parses each god type page (Wei, Shu, etc.) and returns a list of the gods on that page. These gods are outputed in a JSON array of SanguoshaHero objects. The parser can be found in the Parser App folder.
